While Gardevoir ex is the most important card in the Gardevoir deck, it's more for it's ability rather than the attack. 190 damage is a fairly good amount of damage to deal, but the ability can power up other Pokemon that can do signicantly more damage. Gardevoir ex is a solid attacker though as it has a lot of HP.
